# cl-ansi-text

Because color in your terminal is nice.
![CI](https://github.com/pnathan/cl-ansi-text/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

Installation: `(ql:quickload :cl-ansi-text)`

## Usage example -

The main macro is `with-color`, which creates an enviroment where everything that is put on `stream` gets colored according to `color`.

Color options comes in several forms.

### Keyword Symbol

Basic 8 colors in the 3-bit color mode are supported, which are `:black`, `:red`, `:green`, `:yellow`, `:blue`, `:magenta`, `:cyan` and `:white`.

```lisp
* (with-color (:red)
    (princ "Gets printed red...")
    (princ "and this too!"))
; Gets printed red...and this too!
; => "and this too!"
```
### `CL-COLORS:RGB` and `CL-COLORS:HSV` object

These are color structures from `CL-COLORS2` (a maintained fork of `CL-COLORS`).
`CL-COLORS2` has several constants e.g. `cl-colors:+red+` that holds the corresponding color values.
`CL-COLORS2` also supports useful blending operations on colors.
Note that `CL-COLORS2` library provides a package `CL-COLORS`, not `CL-COLORS2`.

### Hex representation

These are CSS-style color strings such as `"#FF0000"`.

### Integer as a 24-bit color

It treats an integer as a hex string.
The bottom 8 bit is used for the blue, the 8th to 16th bits are used for green,
the 16th to 24th bits are used for red.
Remaining bits are ignored.

### List of numbers as a 24-bit color

It takes a list of three numbers (RGB) between 0 and 256.

## Function interface for printing in specific colors

We provide shorthand functions for generating a colored strings:

```lisp
* (yellow "Yellow string")
; => "Yellow string"
* (princ (yellow "String with yellow background" :style :background))
; "String with yellow background"
; => "String with yellow background"
* (princ
   (concatenate
    'string
    (yellow "Five") " test results went " (red "terribly wrong") "!"))
; Five test results went terribly wrong!
; => "Five test results went terribly wrong!"
```

You can bind the `*enabled*` special variable to `nil` to control the colorization:

```lisp
* (let (cl-ansi-text:*enabled*)
    (princ (red "This string is printed normally")))
```

# API

## *Type* color-specifier

``` lisp
(or unsigned-byte
    (cons (real 0 256)
          (cons (real 0 256)
                (cons (real 0 256)
                      null)))
    cl-colors:rgb
    cl-colors:hsv
    term-colors
    color-string)
```

## *Type* term-colors

``` lisp
(member :black :red :green :yellow :blue :magenta :cyan :white)
```

## *Type* color-string

A string of length 3, 4, 6, or 7, that optionally starts with a `#`, and
the rest consists of 3 or 6 hexademical alphadigits (case-insensitive).

## *Macro* with-color

``` lisp
with-color (color &key (stream t) (effect :unset) (style :foreground)) &body body
```

Writes out the ANSI escape code string
denoting `effect`, `style`, and a switch to `color`, then executes `body`,
then writes out the string that resets the decoration.

## *Function* make-color-string

``` lisp
make-color-string color &key (effect :unset) (style :foreground) enabled
```

Takes an object of `color-specifier` and returns a string sufficient to change to the given color.

Colorization is controlled by *enabled* unless manually specified otherwise by `:enabled` keyword.

## *Function* black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white

Shortcut functions that takes a single argument, `string`, and returns a string
decorated by the corresponding color.

## *Special variable* `*enabled*`

Turns on/off the colorization.

## *Special variable* `*color-mode*`

Controls the way `make-color-string` emits the color code.

It should be one of the following keyword symbols: `:3bit`, `:8bit`, `:24bit`.
The specified color is converted to the nearest color in the color space.
The default value is `:8bit`.

Note that the actual appearance of the screen in the `:3bit` mode may be affected by
the terminal setting -- For example, many terminals do not use `FF0000` for the red.

## *Constant* `+reset-color-string+`

A constant string that resets the color state of the terminal.


# Running test

Run `./testscr.ros` with Roswell. You can also manually run the test with
`(ql:quickload :cl-ansi-text.test) (fiveam:run! :cl-ansi-text)`.


## CI tests

You can view the list of lisp implementation this library is tested on
the Github Action tab. The testing environment is Linux, but we
believe this should work also on OSX.


# Note

Note that your terminal MUST be ANSI-compliant to show these
colors.

SLIME REPL does not display these colors by default (2019.12.13).
To make it understand the ANSI escape sequence,
install `slime-repl-ansi-color` package available from [MELPA](https://melpa.org/)
using `package-install` and add the following in `.emacs`:

``` lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'slime-repl
  (require 'slime-repl-ansi-color))
(add-hook 'slime-repl-mode-hook 'slime-repl-ansi-color-mode)
```
